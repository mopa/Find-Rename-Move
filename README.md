# Video Organize

This a simple `Bash` script that find the files with extension you want, rename and move to any directory.

The first purpose of this script is for video organizing for platforms like Plex, Kodi, Jellyfin, etc.

Only need put the script in a dir and run!


PD: More improvements are coming...
